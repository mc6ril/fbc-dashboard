# Fix Bug (Quick Path)

You are fixing a **simple bug** (visual, logic, or behavior).

1. Identify the **root cause** and explain it in 1–2 lines.
2. Suggest the **minimal code change** needed to fix it.
3. Confirm no architecture, navigation, or state structure changes are needed.
4. Propose **ONE** focused unit test to lock the behavior.
5. Output a **diff** only (no explanations beyond rationale).
