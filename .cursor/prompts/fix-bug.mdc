# Fix Bug (Quick Path)

You are fixing a **simple bug** (visual, logic, or behavior).

## Usage

Use this prompt for quick bug fixes that don't require architectural changes or full test suites. This is the fastest path for simple fixes like:
- Visual bugs (styling, layout)
- Logic errors (wrong condition, typo)
- Behavior issues (missing handler, incorrect state update)

**When to use**:
- Bug is isolated and well-defined
- Fix is straightforward (< 10 lines of code)
- No architecture or layer changes needed
- Quick turnaround required

**When NOT to use**:
- Bug requires architectural refactoring
- Multiple files or layers affected
- Complex business logic changes needed
- Use `/pm-plan-from-ticket` or `@dev-agent` instead

## Steps

1. Identify the **root cause** and explain it in 1–2 lines.
2. Suggest the **minimal code change** needed to fix it.
3. Confirm no architecture, layer separation, or state structure changes are needed.
4. Propose **ONE** focused unit test to lock the behavior.
5. Output a **diff** only (no explanations beyond rationale).

## Examples

**Example 1**: Visual bug
```
@fix-bug.mdc
Bug: Button color is wrong. Should be primary color from SCSS variables.
File: src/presentation/components/ui/Button.tsx
```

**Example 2**: Logic error
```
@fix-bug.mdc
Bug: isLowStock function returns true when stock is 0, should return false.
File: src/core/domain/product.ts
```

**Example 3**: Missing handler
```
@fix-bug.mdc
Bug: Click handler not called on ProductCard. onEdit prop is passed but not used.
File: src/presentation/components/ProductCard.tsx
```
