# UI Component from Design

Analyze the attached image and generate a Next.js component using SCSS variables from `styles/variables/*` and accessibility utilities from `shared/a11y/`.

Provide:

1. **Component Hierarchy** — Layout + reusable components from presentation/components/ui/
2. **Accessibility Setup** — Labels, roles, ARIA attributes using shared/a11y/ utilities
3. **Responsive Design** — CSS media queries, SCSS variables for spacing/sizing
4. **Code Output** — Component using SCSS variables (no hardcoded values)
5. **State Management** — Controlled via props only (no business logic here, use React Query hooks for data)
