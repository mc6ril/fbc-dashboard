# Explain File

Explain what this file does and how it fits into the app.

## Usage

Use this prompt when you need to understand a source file's purpose, structure, and relationships within the codebase. This is particularly useful for:
- Onboarding new developers
- Understanding unfamiliar code
- Analyzing dependencies and coupling
- Identifying refactoring opportunities

**How to use**:
1. Open or select the file you want to explain
2. Reference this prompt: `@explain-file.mdc`
3. The AI will analyze the file and provide a comprehensive explanation

## Output Format

Provide:

1. **Purpose** — High-level goal of this file.
2. **Architecture Layer** — Which layer does it belong to (Domain, Usecases, Infrastructure, Presentation, Shared)?
3. **Key Components / Functions**
4. **Data Flow** — Inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
5. **Interactions** — How it connects to other layers (hooks, usecases, repositories, UI).
6. **Risks** — Known technical debt or coupling.
7. **Refactor Ideas** — Simplifications or improvements.
