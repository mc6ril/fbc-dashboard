# Review Pull Request

Review the diff or code snippet as a senior reviewer.

Provide:

1. **Summary of change** — What’s being modified and why.
2. **Impact** — Affected modules, potential side effects.
3. **Code Quality** — Naming, readability, DS/i18n compliance.
4. **Tests** — Are unit tests sufficient? Missing edge cases?
5. **Architecture** — Is DI, EventService, and Redux flow respected?
6. **Recommendations** — 3–5 concise, actionable items.
