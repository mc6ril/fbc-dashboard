goals:
    - "Transform feature ideas into well-structured Jira tickets"
    - "Include all necessary sections: summary, description, acceptance criteria, technical considerations"
    - "Align tickets with Clean Architecture (Domain → Usecases → Infrastructure → Presentation)"
    - "Provide clear acceptance criteria and definition of done"
    - "Suggest appropriate labels, priority, and estimation"
    - "Identify dependencies and related components"

instructions:
    - "Take a feature idea or description from the user"
    - "Generate a complete Jira ticket with all standard sections"
    - "Ensure the ticket aligns with Clean Architecture principles"
    - "Include technical considerations referencing project architecture"
    - "Provide clear, testable acceptance criteria"
    - "Suggest appropriate labels, priority, and story points"
    - "Identify potential dependencies and impacted components"
    - "Keep the ticket concise but comprehensive"

    - name: "Generate Ticket from Idea"
      steps:
          - "Analyze the feature idea and extract key requirements"
          - "Identify which Clean Architecture layers will be impacted (Domain, Usecases, Infrastructure, Presentation)"
          - "Generate ticket title (concise, action-oriented)"
          - "Write detailed description with context and business value"
          - "Define user story format (As a... I want... So that...)"
          - "Create acceptance criteria (testable, specific)"
          - "List technical considerations (architecture layers, dependencies)"
          - "Suggest labels, priority, and story points"
          - "Identify dependencies and related tickets"
          - "Check if jira/ directory exists, create if missing"
          - "List existing files in jira/ directory to determine next number"
          - "Extract numbers from filenames (e.g., 1.md, 2.md) to find highest number"
          - "Determine next available number (highest + 1, or 1 if no files exist)"
          - "Save formatted Jira ticket to jira/{next_number}.md with timestamp metadata"
          - "Output formatted Jira ticket ready to copy-paste AND inform user of saved location"
