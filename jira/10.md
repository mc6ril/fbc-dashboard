# Create Supabase tables: products, activities (optional: stock_movements)

-   Type: Task
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 5
-   Labels: supabase, database, schema
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-10-create-supabase-tables

## Description

Provision initial database schema on Supabase:

-   products: id, name, type, unit_cost, sale_price, stock, created_at
-   activities: id, product_id, type, date, quantity, amount, note
-   (optional) stock_movements: derive from activities if not created

## User Story

As a maintainer, I need a normalized schema to store products and activities so that the application can persist and query data reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   SQL migrations or Supabase SQL scripts checked in under `infrastructure/supabase/` (or `sql/`).
-   Tables created with appropriate types and constraints (FKs, not null where relevant).
-   Enum alignment with domain enums (store as text with constraint or PostgreSQL enums).
-   Indices for frequent queries (e.g., activities by date, product_id).

## Technical Considerations

-   Keep schema minimal for MVP; allow extension later.
-   UTC timestamps; consistent naming conventions (snake_case).

## Definition of Done

-   Schema applied to Supabase dev project.
-   Scripts documented in README for re-application.
-   Build/lint green.
