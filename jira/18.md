# Expand unit test coverage (domain, usecases, reusable UI) with Jest

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 5
- Labels: testing, jest, coverage
- Git Branch: feat/fbc-18-expand-unit-tests

## Description
Increase unit test coverage for domain rules, usecases orchestration, and reusable UI components using Jest (project standard). Mirror source structure under `__tests__/` and follow project testing rules.

## User Story
As a maintainer, I want reliable tests so that regressions are prevented and refactors are safe.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tests live in `__tests__/` only; TypeScript used for all tests.
- Domain and usecases tests added with repository mocks.
- Reusable UI components tested with React Testing Library (no page tests).
- Coverage improved and reported via existing Jest config.

## Technical Considerations
- Follow existing Jest setup (`jest.config.ts`, `jest.setup.ts`).
- Use manual mocks in `__mocks__/` when applicable.

## Definition of Done
- CI-ready test suite passing locally.
- Coverage trend documented in README or PR.
- Lint/build/tests green.

## Related Components
- `__tests__/core/*`
- `__tests__/presentation/components/ui/*`
