# Create repository interfaces (ports): Activity, Product, Stock

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 3
-   Labels: ports, repository, clean-architecture
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-8-create-repository-ports

## Description

Define repository interfaces in `core/ports/` for Activity, Product, and Stock handling. These ports represent stable contracts for data access to be implemented by Supabase.

## User Story

As a backend-leaning developer, I want clear repository interfaces so that infrastructure implementations can be swapped without affecting business logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   `ActivityRepository`, `ProductRepository`, `StockRepository` defined in `src/core/ports/`.
-   Ports include methods for CRUD and query operations needed by upcoming usecases.
-   All methods return domain types and explicit error handling via thrown errors.
-   Documentation of contracts, invariants, and expected errors present in ports.

## Technical Considerations

-   No implementations in ports — contracts only.
-   Keep method signatures minimal and purposeful for MVP (extendable later).

## Definition of Done

-   Ports exported for use by usecases.
-   Unit tests for usecases can mock these ports.
-   Lint/build green.

## Related Components

-   `src/core/ports/*`
