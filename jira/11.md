# Implement Supabase repositories for Activity and Product

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 5
-   Labels: infrastructure, supabase, repositories
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-11-implement-supabase-repositories

## Description

Provide concrete Supabase implementations of the repository ports:

-   activityRepositorySupabase
-   productRepositorySupabase

Map between Supabase rows and domain models with clear error handling.

## User Story

As a developer, I want repository implementations so that usecases can interact with real persisted data.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Implementations in `src/infrastructure/supabase/` conform exactly to ports.
-   Strict mapping from DB columns to domain fields (document any assumptions).
-   Errors are propagated (no silent failures).
-   No UI or React imports.

## Technical Considerations

-   Use existing Supabase client (`infrastructure/supabase/client.ts`).
-   Keep mapping functions small and testable.
-   Prepare for pagination and filters (basic versions only if needed).

## Definition of Done

-   Unit tests through usecases (repositories mocked where relevant).
-   Manual smoke test of basic CRUD via a simple script or page.
-   Build/lint green.

## Related Components

-   `src/infrastructure/supabase/activityRepositorySupabase.ts`
-   `src/infrastructure/supabase/productRepositorySupabase.ts`
