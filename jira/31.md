# FBC-31: Reorganize navigation - Rename Stats to Analyses

## Type

Refactoring / Technical Debt

## Priority

Medium

## Story Points

2

## Labels

`navigation`, `refactoring`, `ui`, `routing`, `i18n`

## Git Branch

`feat/fbc-31-rename-stats-to-analyses`

## Description

Reorganize the dashboard navigation by renaming the "Statistiques" tab to "Analyses" and updating the route from `/dashboard/stats` to `/dashboard/analyses`. This is the first step in the dashboard reorganization to separate concerns: Dashboard (overview widgets), Analyses (charts and trends), and Revenus (detailed financial table).

This change prepares the codebase for the new "Revenus" tab that will be added in subsequent tickets.

## User Story

As a user, I want clearer navigation labels so that I can easily distinguish between the overview dashboard, detailed analyses, and financial revenue tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Route renamed from `/dashboard/stats` to `/dashboard/analyses`**:

    - Create new page at `src/app/dashboard/analyses/page.tsx`
    - Move all content from `src/app/dashboard/stats/page.tsx` to the new location
    - Delete `src/app/dashboard/stats/` directory after migration
    - Update all internal links and redirects to use `/dashboard/analyses`

2. **Navigation updated**:

    - Update `DashboardNavbar.tsx` to use `/dashboard/analyses` route
    - Update translation key from `stats` to `analyses` in navigation items
    - Verify active state detection works correctly for the new route

3. **Translations updated**:

    - Add `analyses` key to `dashboard.navbar` in `fr.json`
    - Update page title translation if needed
    - Keep `stats` key for backward compatibility during migration (remove after verification)

4. **All existing functionality preserved**:
    - All charts load correctly on the new route
    - No broken links or 404 errors
    - All dynamic imports work as expected

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Layers Impacted

-   **Presentation Layer** (`presentation/components/dashboardNavbar/`):

    -   Update `DashboardNavbar.tsx` navigation items array
    -   Change route from `/dashboard/stats` to `/dashboard/analyses`
    -   Update translation key from `stats` to `analyses`

-   **Presentation Layer** (`app/dashboard/`):

    -   Create `analyses/page.tsx` (copy from `stats/page.tsx`)
    -   Delete `stats/` directory after migration
    -   Update any internal links if present

-   **Shared Layer** (`shared/i18n/messages/`):
    -   Add `analyses` translation key in `fr.json`
    -   Update page title translation if needed

### Route Migration Strategy

1. Create new route first (`/dashboard/analyses`)
2. Update navigation to point to new route
3. Test all functionality
4. Delete old route (`/dashboard/stats`)

### Backward Compatibility

-   Consider adding a redirect from `/dashboard/stats` to `/dashboard/analyses` if users have bookmarked the old URL
-   Remove redirect after a reasonable transition period

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] New route `/dashboard/analyses` created with all content from `/dashboard/stats`
-   [ ] `DashboardNavbar.tsx` updated to use new route and translation key
-   [ ] Translation `analyses` added to `fr.json`
-   [ ] All charts load correctly on new route
-   [ ] Old route `/dashboard/stats` deleted
-   [ ] Optional: Redirect from old route to new route added
-   [ ] All existing tests pass
-   [ ] Navigation tests updated if needed
-   [ ] No broken links or 404 errors
-   [ ] No linter errors

## Related Components

### Files to Modify

-   `src/presentation/components/dashboardNavbar/DashboardNavbar.tsx`
-   `src/shared/i18n/messages/fr.json`

### Files to Create

-   `src/app/dashboard/analyses/page.tsx` (copy from stats)
-   `src/app/dashboard/analyses/page.module.scss` (copy from stats)

### Files to Delete

-   `src/app/dashboard/stats/page.tsx`
-   `src/app/dashboard/stats/page.module.scss`

### Files to Test

-   `__tests__/presentation/components/dashboardNavbar/DashboardNavbar.test.tsx`

## Dependencies

-   None (standalone refactoring task)

## Notes

-   This is a pure refactoring task with no new functionality
-   All existing charts and components remain unchanged
-   This prepares for the addition of the "Revenus" tab in FBC-33
-   The translation key change makes the navigation more semantic and aligned with the new structure
