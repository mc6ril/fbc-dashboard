## Jira Ticket

**Title:** Add run script for project commands (clean, build, start, dev)

**Type:** Task

**Priority:** Medium

**Story Points:** 2

**Labels:** tooling, development, infrastructure

**Git Branch:** `feat/fbc-1-add-run-script`

**Branch Creation:**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/fbc-1-add-run-script
```

---

**Description:**

Currently, developers need to manually execute individual npm/yarn commands (`yarn dev`, `yarn build`, `yarn start`) or remember the exact commands for cleaning the project. This creates friction in the development workflow and increases the likelihood of errors when switching between different project operations.

A centralized run script at the root of the project (not in a subdirectory) will provide a unified interface for common development tasks, making it easier for developers to perform common operations like cleaning the project, building, starting the production server, or launching the development server. The script will be callable with `sh run <command>` syntax (e.g., `sh run dev`, `sh run build`, `sh run start`, `sh run clean`). This improves developer experience and reduces context switching between the terminal and package.json to check available commands.

The script should be located at the project root and support multiple operations, allowing developers to quickly switch between development and production modes, as well as perform maintenance tasks like cleaning build artifacts and dependencies. Developers will call commands using `sh run <command>` syntax.

**User Story:**

As a developer
I want a centralized run script at the root of the project
So that I can easily execute common commands (clean, build, start, dev) without needing to remember individual yarn/npm commands

**Acceptance Criteria:**

-   [ ] AC1: A run script file named `run` is created at the root of the project (not in a subdirectory)
-   [ ] AC2: The script supports a `clean` command that removes build artifacts (`.next/` directory) and `node_modules` if needed
-   [ ] AC3: The script supports a `build` command that runs the Next.js build process (`yarn build`)
-   [ ] AC4: The script supports a `start` command that runs the production server (`yarn start`)
-   [ ] AC5: The script supports a `dev` command that runs the development server (`yarn dev`)
-   [ ] AC6: The script displays clear usage instructions when called without arguments or with invalid commands
-   [ ] AC7: The script can be executed with `sh run <command>` (e.g., `sh run dev`, `sh run build`, `sh run start`, `sh run clean`)
-   [ ] AC8: The script handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages

**Technical Considerations:**

-   **Architecture Layers Impacted:**

    -   Domain: None (tooling script, no business logic)
    -   Usecases: None (script is outside Clean Architecture layers)
    -   Infrastructure: None (script executes existing commands)
    -   Presentation: None (script is a terminal utility)

-   **Dependencies:**

    -   Existing package.json scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`)
    -   Node.js/npm/yarn must be installed
    -   Next.js build process

-   **Data Flow:**

    -   Script → Package Manager (yarn/npm) → Next.js/React Application
    -   No data flow through Clean Architecture layers (pure utility script)

-   **Script Location:**

    -   Root directory of the project: `run` (at project root, not in a subdirectory)
    -   Script must be callable with `sh run <command>` syntax
    -   Use bash or shell script (compatible with macOS/Linux)

-   **Testing:**
    -   Manual testing of all script commands
    -   Verify script executes correctly in different environments (macOS, Linux)
    -   Test error handling for invalid commands and missing dependencies
    -   Verify clean command removes correct directories

**Definition of Done:**

-   [ ] Script file named `run` created at project root (not in a subdirectory)
-   [ ] Script supports all required commands (clean, build, start, dev)
-   [ ] Script is executable (chmod +x)
-   [ ] Script includes usage instructions and error handling
-   [ ] Script tested manually on development machine
-   [ ] README.md updated with script usage documentation (optional but recommended)
-   [ ] Code reviewed and approved
-   [ ] No impact on existing Clean Architecture layers (script is external utility)

**Related Components:**

-   Files to create:

    -   `run` (script file at project root, not in a subdirectory)
    -   Consider adding usage documentation in `README.md`

-   Related files:

    -   `package.json` (references existing scripts)
    -   `.gitignore` (may need to ignore build artifacts cleaned by script)

-   Implementation notes:
    -   Script must be located at project root (same level as `package.json`, `next.config.ts`)
    -   Script should be callable with `sh run <command>` syntax (e.g., `sh run dev`, `sh run build`)
    -   Consider adding shebang line: `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
    -   Script should detect if yarn/npm is available
    -   Consider adding flags for verbose output or dry-run mode
