# Page: Dashboard Overview (MVP widgets)

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 8
-   Labels: ui, dashboard, widgets, mvp
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-12-dashboard-overview

## Description

Create Dashboard Overview page with initial widgets:

-   Total sales for the month
-   Profit for the month
-   Low stock products
-   Recent activities

## User Story

As a user, I want an overview showing key metrics so that I can quickly assess business performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Page at `/dashboard` displays the four widgets.
-   Use React Query hooks calling usecases; no direct infra calls.
-   Reusable UI components from DS (Text, Heading, Card, etc.).
-   Accessible structure with headings and landmarks.

## Technical Considerations

-   Add hooks like `useMonthlySales`, `useMonthlyProfit`, `useLowStock`, `useRecentActivities` that call usecases.
-   Memoize expensive computations in hooks (select, staleTime).
-   No business logic inside components.

## Definition of Done

-   Visuals match minimal MVP design.
-   Performance: avoid unnecessary re-renders (memoization/callbacks).
-   Lint/build/tests green.
