# Define application navigation structure (App Router)

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 3
-   Labels: navigation, routing, app-router, mvp
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-6-define-navigation-structure

## Description

Establish the initial navigation structure using Next.js App Router. Create routes for authentication and dashboard sections per the roadmap:

-   /signin
-   /signup
-   /dashboard
-   /dashboard/stats
-   /dashboard/activities
-   /dashboard/catalog

## User Story

As an authenticated user, I want a clear navigation structure so that I can access sign-in/up and core dashboard pages quickly and consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Routes exist and render placeholder pages with proper layouts.
-   Public routes: /signin, /signup. Private routes under /dashboard/\* are guarded.
-   Navigation link structure is consistent and discoverable (Navbar/Sidebar + Header).
-   No business logic in pages; pages consume hooks for data when available.
-   All new pages pass basic accessibility checks (landmarks, heading levels).

## Technical Considerations

-   Presentation: Next.js App Router pages and layouts under `src/app/`.
-   Presentation: Guard wrapper for restricted/private pages (uses Auth state from providers).
-   No Supabase calls in pages; only via hooks when needed.
-   Add skeleton components/placeholders for content (to be replaced by later tickets).

## Definition of Done

-   Pages and layouts created with correct folder structure.
-   Public/private route separation verified.
-   Basic a11y landmarks in each page (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>` where applicable).
-   Lint passes and build succeeds.
-   Ticket documented and linked in changelog/PR.
