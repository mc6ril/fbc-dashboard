# Page: Activities (filterable log)

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 8
-   Labels: ui, activities, filters, table
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-13-activities-log

## Description

Build an Activities page showing a filterable, paginated table:

-   Filters: date range, type, product
-   CTA to add new activity

## User Story

As a user, I want to review and filter past activities so that I can analyze operations and find specific events quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Page at `/dashboard/activities` with table and filters.
-   Filters do not cause unnecessary re-renders; use stable query keys and `select`.
-   “Add Activity” button navigates to `/dashboard/activities/new` (or dedicated add page).
-   Accessibility: table markup with headers, captions, and proper labels.

## Technical Considerations

-   React Query with stable keys and `staleTime`.
-   Avoid inline functions and object creation in render paths.
-   Split into smaller memoized components if needed.

## Definition of Done

-   Smooth filtering without layout shifts.
-   Performance and a11y checks passed.
-   Lint/build/tests green.
