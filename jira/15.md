# Business analytics: statistics (daily/monthly/yearly)

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: Medium
-   Story Points: 8
-   Labels: analytics, stats, business
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-15-business-statistics

## Description

Provide usecases and hooks to compute:

-   Profits (daily / monthly / yearly)
-   Total creations
-   Total sales
-   Margins by product

## User Story

As a business owner, I want key statistics so that I can understand performance over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Usecases compute stats from activities/products without UI logic.
-   Hooks expose data with proper caching (`staleTime`) and `select`.
-   Types explicitly defined; no `any`.

## Technical Considerations

-   Ensure period filters and aggregation are efficient.
-   Avoid recomputation via memoization and stable keys.

## Definition of Done

-   Unit tests for aggregation logic with edge cases.
-   Lint/build/tests green.
