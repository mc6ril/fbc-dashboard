# Add GitHub Actions CI: lint, tests, build

- Type: Task
- Priority: Medium
- Story Points: 3
- Labels: ci, github-actions, quality
- Git Branch: feat/fbc-19-add-ci-github-actions

## Description
Add GitHub Actions workflow to run lint, tests, and build on pull requests and main branch pushes. Ensure caches are used to speed up runs.

## User Story
As a maintainer, I want automated checks so that code quality and build integrity are enforced on each PR.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workflow file under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Steps: checkout, setup Node, install deps (Yarn), run lint, run tests, run build.
- Cache Yarn and Next.js build as appropriate.
- Status badges (optional) in README.

## Technical Considerations
- Node LTS version, consistent with project.
- Use `yarn check:all` for linting if applicable.

## Definition of Done
- CI runs automatically on PRs and main pushes.
- All steps pass on current codebase.
- Documentation in README.

## Related Components
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
