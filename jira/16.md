## Description

Add charts to visualize trends:

-   Sales per month
-   Activities over time
-   Profit vs Cost

## User Story

As a user, I want visual charts so that I can quickly grasp trends and anomalies.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Recharts integrated into dashboard/stats pages.
-   Data comes from hooks/usecases; no business logic in components.
-   Accessible fallback text and descriptions for charts.

## Technical Considerations

-   Lazy-load heavy chart components (dynamic import).
-   Ensure responsiveness and avoid layout shifts.

## Definition of Done

-   Charts render with sample/test data paths.
-   Lint/build/tests green.

## Related Components

-   `src/app/dashboard/stats/page.tsx`
-   `src/presentation/components/*`
