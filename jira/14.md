# Page: Add Activity (form with dynamic fields)

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: High
-   Story Points: 5
-   Labels: ui, form, activities
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-14-add-activity-page

## Description

Create Add Activity page with a form that adapts to activity type:

-   Type select (CREATION, SALE, STOCK_CORRECTION, OTHER)
-   CREATION → quantity + product + add to stock
-   SALE → remove from stock + amount
-   Optional note

## User Story

As a user, I want to record new activities so that stock and analytics remain up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Page at `/dashboard/activities/new` (or `/dashboard/add-activity`).
-   Form validates inputs and reflects errors accessibly.
-   On submit, calls `addActivity` usecase via React Query mutation.
-   Success feedback and redirect/back to activities list.

## Technical Considerations

-   Use DS components (Input, Select, Button, Text).
-   Centralize a11y IDs and error announcements via `shared/a11y/`.
-   No business logic in component; usecases do orchestration.

## Definition of Done

-   Accessible form with labels, descriptions, and error messages.
-   Mutation success/failure announced (aria-live).
-   Lint/build/tests green.

## Related Components

-   `src/app/dashboard/activities/new/page.tsx`
-   `src/presentation/components/ui/*`
-   `src/presentation/hooks/*`
