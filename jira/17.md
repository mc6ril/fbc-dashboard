# Add Zod validation for domain and forms

-   Type: Feature
-   Priority: Medium
-   Story Points: 3
-   Labels: validation, zod, domain
-   Git Branch: feat/fbc-17-add-zod-validation

## Description

Introduce Zod schemas to validate domain data and form inputs for activities and products. Use schemas for runtime validation and type inference where helpful.

## User Story

As a developer, I want robust validation so that bad data is caught early and users receive clear error messages.

## Acceptance Criteria

-   Zod schemas for Activity and Product inputs created.
-   Form validation uses Zod; error messages are accessible.
-   No Zod in pure domain types; schemas live in a suitable layer (e.g., shared/validation or presentation forms), while keeping domain pure.

## Technical Considerations

-   Keep domain layer pure; avoid importing Zod in `core/domain`.
-   Ensure error mapping is clear and testable.

## Definition of Done

-   Validation integrated into Add Activity form path.
-   Unit tests for schemas and edge cases.
-   Lint/build/tests green.
